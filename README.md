If you can't install an environment in your computer, you can use [Replit](https://replit.com/~) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to simulate and learn.

Maybe CodeSandbox is better:
- Provide React tool to see components status
- Provide detail error messages
- Although it doesn't provide shell window, you can add packages in Dependences window

Note: 

Replit seems can't open two shell window, so you can't use it to complete Ex 2.11

Update: 

Find methods to complete Ex 2.11

You can use Node HTTP Server Template to create Sandbox, it allows you use multiple terminals.

Tips:
* install dependencies from its Dependencies pannel
* change `scripts` in `package.json`:
  ``` json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "react-scripts start",
      "build": "react-scripts build",
      "test": "react-scripts test",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    }
  ```
* run json-server and react app by terminal, remember set json-server port like the lecture guide
* in codesanbox, open browser pannel when codesandbox question you whether to open, and you can get the json-server address to use
