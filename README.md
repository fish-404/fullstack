If you can't install an environment in your computer, you can use [Replit](https://replit.com/~) to simulate adn learn.

You can also use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to simulate. Maybe CodeSandbox is better. It provide React tool in the playgraound so that you don't need open you web in a new tab and install a extention React tool. But web environment in CodeSandbox doesn't support shell.

Update: 

Replit seems can't open two shell window, so you can't use it to complete Ex 2.11

Haven't find methods use CodeSandbox to complete Ex 2.11. The Container Environment can support multiple terminal, but it can't sync all files in the files tree. It means the files you create in terminal can't be shown in file tree, and I haven't find methods to open files in the editor using terminal.
