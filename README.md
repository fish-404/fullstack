If you can't install an environment in your computer, you can use [Replit](https://replit.com/~) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to simulate and learn.

Maybe CodeSandbox is better:
- Provide React tool to see components status
- Provide detail error messages
- Although it doesn't provide shell window, you can add packages in Dependences window

Note: 

Replit seems can't open two shell window, so you can't use it to complete Ex 2.11

Haven't find methods using CodeSandbox to complete Ex 2.11. The Container Environment can support multiple terminal, but it can't sync all files in the files tree. It means the files you create in terminal can't be shown in file tree, and I haven't find methods to open files in the editor using terminal.

An idea to complete Ex 2.11, you can open two codesandbox, and one use josn-server environmnet. Haven't take a test yet.
